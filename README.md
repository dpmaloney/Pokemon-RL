# Pokemon-RL
Pokemon Reinforcement Learning Bot

Based on [Poke-ENV](https://github.com/hsahovic/poke-env/)

## Todo
- Make selfplay algorithm
- Make script to download replays from OU games
- Get a bunch of good OU teams
- Make "elo-world" clone for training AI vs other agents
- Alpha star type beat for training/evaluating/selecting agents [BLOG LINK](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii)
- ??#1 on pokemon showdown ladder??
